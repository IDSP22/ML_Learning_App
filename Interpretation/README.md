I can't find any interpretation for qualititive predictors, logistic regression, LDA and QDA. There are a lot of texts which I don't think will be helpful to just 
put on our app. People might get exhausted and tired when reading so many paragraphs.


I would recommend instead of copying and pasting the text to our app. For modules that have a lot of txt, we should let the user to engage with the materials. For example, we could ask them questions including multiple choice questions, or matching games, or even just a comparison graph between different methods such as LDA Versus QDA. Since there are not many graphs available to this module.
