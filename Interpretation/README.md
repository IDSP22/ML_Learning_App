I can't find any interpretation for qualititive predictors, logistic regression, LDA and QDA. 


I would recommend instead of copying and pasting the text to our app. For modules that have a lot of txt, we should let the user to engage with the materials. For example, we could ask them questions including multiple choice questions, or matching games, or even just a comparison graph between different methods such as LDA Versus QDA. Since there are not many graphs available to this module.

I have included knn interactive plot in the knn markdown. It is just a small demo, hope you like it!
