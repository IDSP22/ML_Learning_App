### Definition of Simple Linear Regression

> All models are wrong; some models are useful... (George Box)

* Predict a quantitative response Y using a single predictor X
* The simplest of all is a (simple) linear regression model; that is, the response or target Y satisfies <h1 align="center">$Y = {\beta_0} + {\beta_1}X + {\varepsilon}$</h1>
* $\beta_0$ is the intercept term
* $\beta_1$ is the slope
* $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are coefficients or parameters of the linear model. They are usually **unknown**
* $\varepsilon$ is noise term, which is usually assumed independent of x and mean zero. It is often assumed to be *normally* distributed in theoretical analysis
* Often, we assume the variance of $\varepsilon$ is $\sigma^2$, which is another **unknown** parameter of the simple linear regression model
