### Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
* Model $$(X|Y = k) \sim N(\mu_k, \sum_k)$$
* Compared to LDA, QDA allows (potentially) different covariance matrices
* The decision boundary of QDA is (most likely) not linear
* A quadratic function in x appears in the discriminant function
* In practice, QDA is not as popular as LDA
