Although there are some visualization code online, it is too large(many files) and will not fit into our application. We can add the links to our app so that the students could utilize external likes.

Here are two websites that students can play with LDA in interactive ways:

## 1. Visualizing the LDA using R shiny 

-- A visualization of LDA 
https://analyticmodels.shinyapps.io/DiscriminantAnalysisModelling/
This shinyApp allow for customized dataset, uploading and analyzing self-provided dataset.

-- A shiny app to check the assumptions of linear and quadratic discriminant analysis 
https://thatdatatho.com/r-shiny-app-discriminant-analysis/

-- A visualization app using LDA
https://rsangole.shinyapps.io/LDA_Visual/
This app does not have github code available, still trying to develop my own version.

## 2. Currently trying to figure out a way to develop my own app
